              when I&nbsp;typed my very first line of code. That was in high
              school. I&nbsp;fell in love. I&nbsp;spent months on the Internet
              just reading and watching content about frontend development. And
              while building my first website from scratch, I&nbsp;knew that my

              UI developer. I care about details and incorporating elegant and
              creative design.
